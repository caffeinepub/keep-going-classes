# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Promote Version 7 of the Keep Going Classes app to the live/production environment and confirm it works via post-deploy smoke checks.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy/promote the currently built Version 7 frontend and backend canister code to production.
- Run a live-environment smoke test covering public page loads, Admissions form submission, and Internet Identity login with admin-route access control verification.

**User-visible outcome:** Version 7 is publicly accessible in production; visitors can browse key pages and submit Admissions successfully, and users can log in via Internet Identity while admin-only routes remain protected.
