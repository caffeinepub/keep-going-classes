  "summary": "Diff primarily adds Version 7 promotion/smoke-test checklist documentation and makes several frontend changes to auth/admin guarding, login/logout handling, and admissions success UX/testing hooks. There is no evidence in the diff summary of an actual production promotion/deploy or of executed smoke test results against a live environment.",

      "requirement": "Promote the currently built Version 7 of the Keep Going Classes app to the live/production environment (latest frontend and backend canister code live and publicly accessible).",
      "reason": "The diff shows only documentation/checklists and frontend code changes; it does not show any deployment configuration, canister upgrades, release/promotion steps executed, or production-target changes that would constitute promoting Version 7 live.",

      "requirement": "After Version 7 is live, perform a basic smoke test on the live environment covering public browsing, admissions submission, and Internet Identity login (including admin-only access control).",
      "reason": "A smoke test checklist document was added, but the diff contains no evidence that the smoke test was actually performed on a live environment (e.g., recorded results, logs, CI job run output, or a completed checklist).",
